# NST & YOLO API

API combining YOLO Object Segmentation and Neural Style Transfer 

## Description

This API allows you to perform object segmentation using YOLOv8 and apply neural style transfer to images in 3 different modes. The main goal is to segment selected classes and apply style to the class/ these classes or whole image. Execution time is 0.5s - 1.3s per call and it can vary depending on the server.  

## Endpoints

### Get YOLO Model classes

**Endpoint:** `/get-classes`

**Method:** GET

    }
}
```
### Get Neural Style Transfer trained models

**Endpoint:** `/get-styles`

### Process Image

**Endpoint:** `/process-image`

**Method:** POST

**Description:** Applies object segmentation and neural style transfer to the provided image.

**Request:**

You can use example request listed in the repository by name `send_request.py`.

- `image`: The image file to be processed.
- `info`: Additional information containing the following fields:
  - `style`: The `model_id` value of selected style to be applied for Neural Style Transfer
  - `mode`: The mode for applying the style. Possible values: "CLASS_MODE", "INVERSE_MODE", "FULL_STYLE_MODE".

**Response:**
```
{
  "execution_time": "1.42",
  "processed_image_path": "http://localhost:5000/static/processed_images/b1daf3ac-3585-4aaa-a292-27bd7cc33926.jpg"
}
```
The API will respond with the link to modified image based on the applied object segmentation and neural style transfer.
